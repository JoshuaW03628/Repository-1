# Lesson 3.1 Variables Assignments and Data Abstraction

## What is a variable

- A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value

- It organizes data by labeling it with a descriptive name

- It consists of three parts: name, value, and type

- Using meaningful variables names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables



# Naming Variables

- Keep the name simple but not too vague
- proper syntax, no spaces


## Types of data

- Integer;
- Text/String;
- Boolean;

## What is Data Abstraction

- Method used in coding to represent data in a useful form, by taking away aspects of data that aren't being used in the situation

- Variables and lists are primary tools in data abstraction

- Provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation


## Lists and Strings

- List = ordered sequence of elements

- Element = individual value in a list that is assigned to a unique index
- Index = a way to reference the elements in a list or string using natural numbers; each element of a string is referenced by an index
- String = ordered sequence of characters (Letters, numbers, special characters)


# 3.3 Lesson

## Algorithms

- Algorithms has 3 components

    - Sequencing: Algorithms do tasks in the order of specification.
    - Selection: Helps choose two different outcomes based off a decision.
    - Iteration: If a condition is true, then the code can repeat.

- Algorithms can be represented in two ways

    - Flowcharts or Psuedocode

## Arithmetic Operations

## Variables

- Different ways values can be stored in a variable
    - Numerical value stored in a variable
    - Value of another variable stored in a variable
    - Result of an operation stored in a variable

## Sequence

- 

## String
