<h2 id="what-i-saw">What I saw</h2>

<p>I walked through Mr.Mortensons class first and saw a bunch of people, parents, students, etc. It was cool but I was early so I walked around, I saw art, digital media, games and many other things. What I saw was all positive. No one was upset with their interaction with the teacher and all the parents had nothing but good things to say.</p>

<ul>
  <li>this was a cool photo because it is made by someone I know and hes a Pheonix suns fan so it is funny because it relates to him.</li>
  <li>The colors and the design really pop</li>
  <li>I also hate the pheonix suns</li>
