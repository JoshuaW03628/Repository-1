<ul>
  <li>I started out messing around with keys and trying different things in order to understand the code that i was dealing with.</li>

  <li>I asked around and understood what meant what and what went there it led me to creating all of my questions as well as a name page.</li>
  <li>I added a few extra things in to make sure that I was adept with this process and completed any finishing touches.</li>
  <li>Overall this project was fun and I learned some stuff about javascript.</li>
