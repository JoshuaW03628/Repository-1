<p>Honestly surprised with myself, despite doing it with my friend Eli, I also had some usage from the internet and my blog but I did grasp a lot of the concepts. Some of which are really just basic math</p>

<h1 id="correction-1">Correction 1</h1>

<p><img src="/Repository-1/Q1_incorrect.png/" alt="" /></p>

<p>So for this one I misread the function. I could have gotten this one correct especially because I know iv’e seen it before. Nothing much to reflect on.</p>

<h1 id="correction-2">Correction 2</h1>

<p><img src="/Repository-1/Q2_Correction.png/" alt="" /></p>

<p>For this question it was again a miscalculation on my part, I thought that I knew what it was because im pretty sure in my ability to identify functions.</p>

<h1 id="things-i-looked-up">Things I Looked Up</h1>
