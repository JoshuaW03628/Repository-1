<h2 id="identifying-errors-quiz">Identifying Errors Quiz</h2>

<p>For the Identifying Errors Quiz I scored a 1/3, I got the first question correct with identifying the order of code segments.</p>

<p>In the second question I was asked to identify which set of contents would not work for the function. I chose D, the input being 1,2,3., the correct answer was C, -1,0,1.</p>

<p>In the third question I also answered incorrectly. I was asked to choose which values would not display the correct grade for the value input. I chose 6,7. I realized my mistake because 8 did not fit in the category between 7 and 9 which caused my answer to be only half correct.</p>
