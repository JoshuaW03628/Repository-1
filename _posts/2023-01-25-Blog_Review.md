## Q2, Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

## Q1, How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

Empowering oneself in a digital world involves taking control of one's digital presence and maximizing its benefits while minimizing its risks. You can do this by;

- Learning about digital literacy, online privacy, and the potential risks and benefits of technology. Stay informed about new developments and trends in the digital world.

- Acquire new skills that can help you in your personal and professional life, such as coding, data analysis, or digital marketing.

- Limit your screen time, disconnect from technology regularly, and engage in activities that promote well-being.

- etc.

## Q2, How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

- When someone is empowered, they have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to navigate and thrive in the digital world. To help someone who is not empowered, they can use their skills and resources to educate, support, and empower others.

- One thing you could do is Mentoring, offer to help someone with a specific digital skill or project, and share your knowledge and experience with them.

## Q3, Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

- Paper and red tape can sometimes act as barriers to digital empowerment, especially in situations where government or organizational policies and procedures are not aligned with the use of technology. These barriers can take the form of regulations, restrictions on access to technology, or the lack of resources and support for digital initiatives.

- At Del Norte Specifically these barriers can include outdated technology infrastructure, limited access to technology resources, and a lack of teacher training and support for digital learning; Elsewhere would probably have similar problems.
