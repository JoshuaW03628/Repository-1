## Q1, Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.

### Benefits

- Computers have enabled people to automate many tasks and processes, increasing efficiency and productivity.
- Computers have facilitated instant communication and collaboration, connecting people from all over the world.
- Computers allow for large amounts of data to be collected, processed, and analyzed, providing insights and informing decision-making.

### Harms

-  The collection and use of personal data can lead to privacy violations and the potential misuse of information.
-  The proliferation of fake news and misinformation on the internet can spread rapidly and negatively impact societies.
- Harmful: Automation has led to job displacement, as some tasks can now be performed by machines instead of people.

## Q2, Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

-  There is evidence to suggest that certain technologies, such as social media, can affect dopamine levels and lead to addictive behavior. However, the relationship between technology and dopamine is complex and not fully understood.

- I can say that excessive use of technology can have negative impacts on student success in high school. This can include distractions from studying and sleep disturbances, as well as a decrease in face-to-face communication skills. As I have been affected by this before.

## Q1, How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

Empowering oneself in a digital world involves taking control of one's digital presence and maximizing its benefits while minimizing its risks. You can do this by;

- Learning about digital literacy, online privacy, and the potential risks and benefits of technology. Stay informed about new developments and trends in the digital world.

- Acquire new skills that can help you in your personal and professional life, such as coding, data analysis, or digital marketing.

- Limit your screen time, disconnect from technology regularly, and engage in activities that promote well-being.

- etc.

## Q2, How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

- When someone is empowered, they have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to navigate and thrive in the digital world. To help someone who is not empowered, they can use their skills and resources to educate, support, and empower others.

- One thing you could do is Mentoring, offer to help someone with a specific digital skill or project, and share your knowledge and experience with them.

## Q3, Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

- Paper and red tape can sometimes act as barriers to digital empowerment, especially in situations where government or organizational policies and procedures are not aligned with the use of technology. These barriers can take the form of regulations, restrictions on access to technology, or the lack of resources and support for digital initiatives.

- At Del Norte Specifically these barriers can include outdated technology infrastructure, limited access to technology resources, and a lack of teacher training and support for digital learning; Elsewhere would probably have similar problems.

# 5.3 

## Q1 Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?, If yes or no, justify you conclusion.

- Definitely not, he has a hint of sarcasm in his voice so you can tell hes joking. he probably understands that it was a problem with the face recognition software and not purposely implemented.

### How do you think this happened?

- HP probably only tested white people or people with lighter skin tones, so they did not recognize that the software is racist.

### Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?

- This was not harmful, it was not supposed to work like this so exclude.

### Should it be corrected?

- Most Definitely. Or else they are losing a large audience of buyers for their company.

### What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

- Fix the software and refund people.

# 5.4

## Q1, CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

- I call my idea "Student-Led Solutions to School Challenges." The idea is to encourage students to come up with innovative and practical solutions to common challenges faced in school, such as school safety, bullying, improving the school environment, etc; This crowdsource initiative can empower students to take an active role in improving Del Norte, while also developing critical skills such as problem-solving, collaboration, and leadership.

- We could do this by;
Provide training and resources to help students understand the crowdsource process, including how to develop and present their ideas effectively, Then create an online platform where students can submit their ideas, comment, and vote on each other's submissions.

## Q2, What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

- This could be a possibility, with my project being an arcade we could implement a commenting system or create a discord to help provide feedback on the games/website. This would allow us to improve our project if open to a large audience which can be easily created through outsourcing our social media.
