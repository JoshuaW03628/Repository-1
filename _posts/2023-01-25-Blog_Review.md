## Q1, Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.

### Benefits

- Computers have enabled people to automate many tasks and processes, increasing efficiency and productivity.
- Computers have facilitated instant communication and collaboration, connecting people from all over the world.
- Computers allow for large amounts of data to be collected, processed, and analyzed, providing insights and informing decision-making.

### Harms

-  The collection and use of personal data can lead to privacy violations and the potential misuse of information.
-  The proliferation of fake news and misinformation on the internet can spread rapidly and negatively impact societies.
- Harmful: Automation has led to job displacement, as some tasks can now be performed by machines instead of people.

## Q2, Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

-  There is evidence to suggest that certain technologies, such as social media, can affect dopamine levels and lead to addictive behavior. However, the relationship between technology and dopamine is complex and not fully understood.

- I can say that excessive use of technology can have negative impacts on student success in high school. This can include distractions from studying and sleep disturbances, as well as a decrease in face-to-face communication skills. As I have been affected by this before.
