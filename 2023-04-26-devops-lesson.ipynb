    "The \"User-Agent\" header is a mainstream HTTP header that identifies the client device and software that is making the request. It contains information about the client's operating system, browser, and version number. This header is included in every HTTP request, and it is used by web servers to optimize content for the requesting client. The purpose of the \"User-Agent\" header is to allow web servers to provide the appropriate content to clients based on their capabilities. For example, a web server might provide a different version of a web page to a mobile device than it would to a desktop computer, or it might provide a different version of a web page to Internet Explorer than it would to Firefox or Chrome.

    "\n",
    "1. Explain what CORS is and what it stands for\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism utilized by web browsers to regulate access to resources on a web page from web pages originating from different domains. Its purpose is to prevent malicious web applications from accessing sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe how you would be able to implement CORS into your own websites\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing CORS in a website, the server-side application must specify the origins that are permitted to access its resources by setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. Additionally, the server can set other headers to regulate the types of HTTP methods and headers that are allowed for use in cross-origin requests. By doing so, the server can safeguard sensitive data and ensure that only authorized requests are \n",
    "made to its resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe why you would want to implement CORS into your own websites\n",
    "\n",
    "To permit access to resources that are hosted on a distinct domain, for instance, a third-party API.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How could use CORS to benefit yourself in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "It can show my skills in web security which will allow me to make a decent amount of income and provide for my family.\n",

    "# KASM Hacks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the purpose of \"sudo\" when running commands in terminal?\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in a terminal, you can utilize the \"sudo\" command to run commands with elevated privileges. This allows you to execute commands as the root user, who has unrestricted access to the system and can perform administrative tasks that regular users are unable to do. The use of \"sudo\" is essential when executing tasks that require administrative privileges, such as the installation of software or the modification of system settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are some commands which allow us to look at how the storage of a machine is set up as?\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"df\" command is used to present information regarding the storage capacity of mounted file systems, including the amount of disk space currently being used and the available storage space. By executing this command, users can obtain a snapshot of the current state of their file systems and make informed decisions regarding their storage management strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What do you think are some alternatives to running \"curl -O\" to get the zip file for KASM?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to get a zip file, you can download it straight from a website and store it in a particular directory on your computer. This approach provides you with the freedom to choose where the file will be located and lets you retrieve it effortlessly in the future, without having to go back to the website every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What kind of commands do you think the \"install.sh\" command has and why is it necessary to call it?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you execute the \"install.sh\" command, it's expected that there will be several commands inside that will install the software that the command is linked to. The reason why it's important to use \"install.sh\" is that it simplifies the installation process and makes sure that all the essential components are installed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain in at least 3-4 sentences how deploying KASM is related to/requires other topics talked about in the lesson and/or potential ways to add things mentioned in the lesson to this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying KASM needs an understanding of several concepts taught in the lesson, such as virtualization, Docker, and Kubernetes. You have to know how to create containers using Docker and how to run and manage these containers with Kubernetes. You also need to know how to manage a cluster of servers, which involves monitoring and scaling, using Kubernetes. One way to enhance this guide is to provide examples of how to deploy KASM using Kubernetes and Docker.\n",
